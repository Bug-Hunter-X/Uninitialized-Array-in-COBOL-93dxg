01  WS-AREA. 
    05  WS-COUNT PIC 9(5) VALUE 0. 
    05  WS-TABLE OCCURS 100 TIMES. 
       10  WS-ITEM PIC X(50) VALUE SPACES. 

* This version initializes each element of the WS-TABLE array to spaces ('SPACES').  This ensures that all array elements contain a known and consistent value, preventing the unpredictable behavior caused by uninitialized memory.  Alternative initialization methods could be used, such as setting the array elements to zeros or other specific values, depending on the program's needs.
